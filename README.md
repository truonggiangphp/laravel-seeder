# LaravelSeeder

A Package was developed by River Crane Vietnam (MarketPlace)

Requirements
============

- Laravel >= 5.4
- PHP >= 7.1

Installation
============

- Run ```composer require webikevn/laravel-seeder```
- Add ```Webikevn\LaravelSeeder\SeederServiceProvider::class``` to your providers array in ```app/config/app.php```
- Run ```php artisan vendor:publish``` to push config files to your config folder if you want to override the name of the seeds folder, or the name of the table where seeds are stored


Features
============

- Allows you to seed databases in different environments with different values.
- Allows you to "version" seeds the same way that Laravel currently handles migrations. Running ```php artisan seed``` will only run seeds that haven't already been run.
- Allows you to run multiple seeds of the same model/table
- Prompts you if your database is in production

Usage
============
When you install LaravelSeeder, various artisan commands are made available to you which use the same methodology you're used to using with Migrations.

<table>
<tr><td>seed</td><td>Runs all the seeds in the "seeders" directory that haven't been run yet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>seed:rollback</td><td>Rollback doesn't undo seeding (which would be impossible with an auto-incrementing primary key). It just allows you to re-run the last batch of seeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>seed:reset</td><td>Resets all the seeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>seed:refresh</td><td>Resets and re-runs all seeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>seed:status</td><td>Gets the status of each migratable seeder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>seed:make</td><td>Makes a new seed class in the environment you specify.</td></tr>
<tr><td>seed:install</td><td>You don't have to use this... it will be run automatically when you call "seed"</td></tr>
</table>

Local Development
============
A Dockerfile with PHP 7.2, XDebug and Composer installed is bundled with the project to facilitate local development.

To easily bring up the local development environment, use the Docker Compose configuration:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

By default, the entrypoint script will install the Composer dependencies for you.

To run the test suite, execute the following:

```
docker-compose exec laravel-seeder test.sh
```

To run the code coverage suite, execute the following:
```
docker-compose exec laravel-seeder code-coverage.sh
```

Happy testing!
